# Crossword arranger

Arrange a grid into a crossword of your choice.

#### How to use?

Choose number of rows and columns to get the grid.
Remove or disable cells as needed using the 'cell-type-edit' mode (`type` button).
Add hint numbers using the 'hint-edit' mode (`hint` button).
Enter text using the `char` mode (`char` button).

#### Why?

I made this for a friend who has a habit of solving crosswords found on social networking platforms, drawing it by hand on paper, filling it and sending its photo to others. Hopefully this will offer an easier way.

Tested only on Firefox.
